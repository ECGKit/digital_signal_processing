# Digital Signal Processing

![alt tag](iir_fir_stop.png)

These are the lecture notes which are part of my class Digital Signal
Processing (DSP) class which consists of YouTube clips and 3 extensive
assignments = flipped classroom.

The coding language is Python.

## YouTube clips

The [YouTube Clips](https://www.youtube.com/user/DSPcourse)
are structured in playlists. Every playlist has a specific topic.

## Labwork

The lab is 2 hours / week and we have 3 assignments which cover:

  * Audio manipulation with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to enhance vocals and to perform spectral analysis / detection
  * ECG filtering with Finite Impulse Response filters (FIR) with ECG recorded in the lab (50Hz / DC removal, matched filters & heartbeat / rate detection)
  * Realtime filtering with Infinite Impulse Response filters (IIR) using Arduinos, USB-DUX and Attys to remove noise from a sensor

## Handout

The handout covers more the theoretical aspects which are relevant
for this lecture but also provides a brief introduction into Python.
